# Doc-Chat-AI

**AI-powered document Q&A system for intelligent information retrieval**

## 🎯 Project Overview

Doc-Chat-AI is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload documents, search through them, and ask natural language questions to receive AI-generated answers with citations. Built as a portfolio project to demonstrate modern web development and AI integration skills.

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)

- 📤 **Document Upload** - Support for TXT, MD, and PDF files
- 🔍 **Semantic Search** - Find relevant content using AI embeddings
- 💬 **AI-Powered Q&A** - Ask questions and get contextual answers with citations
- 🎨 **Clean Interface** - Simple, responsive vanilla JavaScript frontend
- 🚀 **RESTful API** - Well-documented FastAPI backend

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI (async web framework)
- SQLite (document & chunk storage)
- OpenAI API (embeddings & chat)

**Frontend:**
- HTML5 + CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Fetch API for backend communication

**Tools & Deployment:**
- Docker (containerization)
- pytest (testing)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

# OpsChat Lite

A document question-answering system with AI-powered search and retrieval. Built with Python and FastAPI as a learning project to demonstrate backend development, database integration, and AI API usage.

## Project Status

🚧 **Phase 1 Complete** - Foundation with document storage and basic search functionality

This project is actively being developed as part of a structured learning plan. Currently implemented features represent Phase 1 of a 3-phase roadmap.

## What It Does

OpsChat Lite allows users to upload documents and ask questions about their content. The system breaks documents into searchable chunks and will eventually use AI to provide intelligent, cited answers.

**Currently Implemented (Phase 1):**
- FastAPI backend with RESTful endpoints
- SQLite database for document and chunk storage
- Health check and ping endpoints
- Database initialization and management
- Project structure ready for file upload and indexing features

**Planned Features (Phase 2-3):**
- Document upload and text extraction
- Intelligent text chunking
- Embedding-based semantic search
- AI-powered question answering with citations
- React frontend interface

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+)
- **Database:** SQLite with plans to migrate to PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **API Server:** Uvicorn
- **Future Integrations:** OpenAI API for embeddings and chat

## Why This Project?

This project demonstrates practical full-stack development skills needed for software developer co-op positions:
- RESTful API design and implementation
- Database schema design and SQL operations
- Modern Python web development with FastAPI
- AI/ML API integration
- Full-stack application architecture
